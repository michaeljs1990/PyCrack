PyCrack README
Version 1.0.0

Supported Hashs: sha1, sha224, sha256, sha384, sha512, blowfish, and crypt(3) sha's.

You will need to supply your own dictionary as I have only added a sample dictionary in the config file consisting of 2000 words. Just replace with with you dictionary and you will be all set to go. It must be named dictionary.txt or you will need to edit the code.

The hashes to be cracked should be entered in the config/cracklist.txt file. For more about how to enter hashes see the wiki

Once you have changed the above option enter...

python pymon.py

Library required to run this are, hashlib, crypr, bcrypt, time, curses, and muliprocessing. If you have any feedback or interest in this project send me an email at mschuett@uwm.edu thanks.
